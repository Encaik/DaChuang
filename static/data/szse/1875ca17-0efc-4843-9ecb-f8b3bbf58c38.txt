Our responsibilitiesunder those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of ourreport. According to the Code of Ethics for Chinese CPA, we are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethicsfor Chinese CPA and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that theaudit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.III.Key Audit MattersKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financialstatements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, andin forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The key audit matters that we identifiedin the audit are as follows:(I)1.Recognition of room incomeFactual descriptionThe Company had operating income of RMB27,906,600 in 2017, of which room income was RMB21,103,100, accounting for75.62% of operating income. According to Note 5.20 of the financial statements of the Company, the room income recognitionprocess of the Company isas follows:(1)For travel agencies and individual guests, make advance collection of payments from them or pre-authorization; recognize55海南大东海旅游中心股份有限公司年年度报告全文2017income of each day after 0:00 of the night of such day after confirmation with the Room Department and the hotel front desk.(2)For websites under agreements, ① guests who book rooms via websites with agreements with the Company shall makeadvance payment of room fees and deposits when they check in and pay the related website service fees according to a certainproportion set out in the agreements and after check by the finance department with the websites. Income of the current day shall berecognized after 00:00 according to the consumption situation after deducting service charges.② for guests who book rooms throughwebsites with agreements with the Company and pay room fees to the websites, income of the current day shall be recognized after00:00 according to the consumption situation and listed as accounts receivable which shall be settled and collected before the fifthday of each month after checking with the websites.(3) For oriented guests, stay in account and make advance collection of payments at the time of check-in according to agreements,recognize income of the current day after 00:00 of each night according to consumption situation, and make regular reconciliation,settlement and collection.Xiruan system will automatically generate daily sales statements for the above business, which shall be audited by examiningpersonnel before submitted to the financial department to prepare accounting vouchers.2.How our audit addressed the matterFor room sales revenue, we understood and evaluated the management's design of internal controls in sales processes from approvalof contracts to the accounting of sales revenue and tested the effectiveness of the implementation of key control points.Via sample inspection of contracts and management interviews, we tested the timing point of significant risks and remunerationrelated to room revenue recognition, and thus assessed the Company's income recognition policies.In addition, we implemented the following procedures in respect of room revenue by using sampling:(1) Analyze income and gross profit margin in combination with the type of income, and judge whether there is any abnormalfluctuation in the income amount in the current period.(2) Choose samples from reservation records and check-in records of rooms, check the samples against the contracts, accountingrecords, invoice issuance and payment receipts related to the corresponding sales, and pay special attention to whether the samplesbefore and after the balance sheet date are included in the correct accounting period to assess whether room revenue is confirmedduring the appropriate period.(3) With respect to new customers and those bringing large amount of income in the current period, implement the externalconfirmation of incurred amounts and the balances, and analyzed the authenticity thereof in combination with the collection ofpayments and occupancy situation. At the same time, inquire the business information of some customers to further confirm theauthenticity of transactions therewith.(II)1.Non-operating income due to write-off of long-term investment and current accountFactual descriptionAccording to the Proposal on Write-off of Long-term Investments and Current Accounts" resolved at the 12th extraordinary meetingof the eighth board of directors of the Company and the fifth extraordinary meeting of the eighth board of supervisors of theCompany, and as resolved at the third extraordinary general meeting of shareholders of the Company in 2017, the Company wrote offoriginal book value of long-term equity investment of RMB 9,716,374.26 in 2017, and provided for the provision for impairment ofRMB 9,716,374.26;wrote off original book value of available-for-sale financial assets of RMB 5,000,000.00, and provided for theprovision for impairment of RMB 5,000,000.00;wrote off a total of 205 sums of accounts receivable with original book value ofRMB80,243,805.62, and provided for the provision for bad debt of RMB80,243,805.62;wrote off a total of 201 sums of accounts56海南大东海旅游中心股份有限公司年年度报告全文2017payable with original book value of RMB1,303,540.11. The write-offs resulted in increase in the Company's non-operating incomeby RMB1,303,540.11 in 2017.2.How our audit addressed the matter(1) We understood the Company's internal control system on write-off of assets and liabilities to judge whether the write-offprocess complied with the requirements. We collected relevant resolutions of the meetings of the board of directors and the thirdextraordinary general meeting of shareholders and media and website announcements.(2)For long-term equity investments, available-for-sale financial assets and claims and debts, we traced the original situations andcollected relevant information to verify the authenticity thereof, and verified the relevant information of the investees and thecreditors and debtors through the Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System and the enterprise verification system. Each of thewritten-off long-term equity investments, available-for-sale financial assets and claims and debts had aging of more than 5 years.(3) We noticed that Hainan Dongfang Guoxin Law Firm issued the Legal Opinion on Time Limitation for Proceedings on Part ofAccounts Payable of Hainan Dadonghai Tourism Centre (Holdings) Co., Ltd. in respect of the above-mentioned written-off payables,in which the law firm believed that the above 201 sums of payables have exceeded the statutory time limitations, and the relevantcreditors have lost their debt recovery right and the right to win. To this end, we conducted necessary communication with HainanDongfang Guoxin Law Firm in respect of the relevant situation on the said write-offs of accounts payable.IV.Other informationThe management of the Company is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises information of theCompany's annual report in 2017, but excludes the financial statements and our auditor's report.Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form ofassurance conclusion thereon.In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, indoing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained inthe audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, weconclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to reportin this regard.V.Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial StatementsThe Company's management is responsible for preparing the financial statements in accordance with the requirements of AccountingStandards for Business Enterprises to achieve a fair presentation, and for designing, implementing and maintaining internal controlthat is necessary to ensure that the financial statements are free from material misstatements, whether due to frauds or errors.In preparing the financial statements, management of the Company is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as agoing concern, disclosing matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management eitherintends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.57海南大东海旅游中心股份有限公司年年度报告全文2017Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.VI.Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial StatementsOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from materialmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a highlevel of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the audit standards will always detect a materialmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in theaggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financialstatements.As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout theaudit. We also:(1)Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design andperform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis forour opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, asfraud may involve collusion, forgery, omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.(2) Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in thecircumstances.(3) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosuresmade by management of the Company.(4) Conclude on the appropriateness of using the going concern assumption by the management of the Company, and conclude,based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significantdoubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required todraw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, tomodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, futureevents or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.(5) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether thefinancial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.(6) Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within theCompany to express an opinion on the financial statements and bear all liability for the opinion.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit andsignificant audit matters, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regardingindependence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on ourindependence, and where applicable, related safeguards.58海南大东海旅游中心股份有限公司年年度报告全文2017From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance inthe audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in ourauditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, wedetermine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably beexpected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.BDO CHINA Shu Lun PanCertified Public Accountant of China:Zhu JianqingCertified Public Accountants LLPCertified Public Accountant of China:Liu ZeboShanghai, China30 August 2018II.

Financial instrumentsFinancial instruments include financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments.10.1 Classification of financial instrumentsUpon initial recognition, financial assets and financial liabilities are classified into: financial assets or financialliabilities measured at fair value through current profit and loss, including financial assets or financial liabilitiesheld for trading and financial assets or financial liabilities directly designated to be measured at fair value throughcurrent profit and loss; held-to-maturity investments; receivables; available-for-sale financial assets; and otherfinancial liabilities, etc.10.2 Recognition and measurement of financial instruments(1)Financial assets (financial liabilities) measured at fair value through current profit and lossFinancial assets (financial liabilities) measured at fair value through current profit and loss are initially recognizedat the fair value upon acquisition (net of cash dividends declared but not yet paid or bond interest due but not yetreceived) and the related transaction costs are included in current profit and loss.The interests or cash dividends to be received during the holding period are recognized as investment income.Change in fair values is included in the current profit and loss at the end of the period.The difference between the fair value and the initial book-entry value is recognized as investment income upondisposal; meanwhile, adjustments are made to profits or losses from changes in fair values.(2)Held-to-maturity investmentsHeld-to-maturity investments are initially recognized at the sum of the fair value (net of bond interest due but notyet received) and related transaction costs upon acquisition.The interest income is calculated and recognized according to amortized costs and effective interest rates (as percoupon rates if the difference between effective interest rates and coupon rates is small) during the holding period,and is included in the investment income. The effective interest rates are determined upon acquisition and remainunchanged during the expected remaining period, or a shorter period if applicable.Upon disposal, the difference between the purchase price obtained and the book value of the investment is76海南大东海旅游中心股份有限公司recognized in investment income.(3)Receivables2017 年年度报告全文For creditor’s rights receivable arising from external sales of goods or rendering of service by the Company andother creditor's rights of other enterprises (excluding liability instruments quoted in an active market) held by theCompany, including accounts receivable, other receivables, notes receivable, prepayment and others, the initialrecognition amount shall be the contract price or agreement price receivable from purchasing party; for those withfinancing nature, they are initially recognized at their present values.Upon recovery or disposal, the difference between the purchase price obtained and the book value of thereceivables is recognized in current profit and loss.(4)Available-for-sale financial assetsFinancial assets (financial liabilities) measured at fair value through current profit and loss are initially recognizedat the fair value and related transaction expenses upon acquisition (net of cash dividends declared but not yet paidor bond interest due but not yet received).The interests or cash dividends to be received during the holding period are recognized as investment income. Theinterest or cash dividends should be measured at fair value and their changes in fair value should be included inother comprehensive income. However, for an equity instrument investment that has no quoted price in an activemarket and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured, and for derivative financial asset linked to the saidequity instrument investment and settled by delivery of the same equity instrument, they shall be measured at cost.Difference between the proceeds and the book value of the financial assets is recognized as investment profit orloss upon disposal; meanwhile, amount of disposal corresponding to the accumulated change in fair value whichis originally and directly included in other comprehensive income shall be transferred out and recognized asinvestment gains or losses.(5)Other financial liabilitiesOther financialliabilities are initially recognized atthe sum of fair value and transaction expenses, andsubsequently measured at amortized costs. Subsequent measurement is conducted at the amortized cost.10.3 Recognition and measurement of transfer of financial assetsWhen a financial assets transfer occurs, the financial assets will be derecognized when substantially all the risksand rewards on the ownership of the financial assets have been transferred to the transferee; and they will not bederecognized if substantially all the risks and rewards on the ownership of the financial assets have been retained.When determining whether the transfer of a financial asset meets the above de-recognition criteria of financialassets, the Company adopts the principle of substance over form. The Company classifies the transfer of afinancial asset into the entire transfer and the partial transfer of financial asset. Where the entire transfer of thefinancial asset meets the de-recognition conditions, the difference of the following two amounts will be includedin current profit and loss:(1)(2)The book value of the transferred financial asset;The sum of the consideration received from the transfer and the accumulated amount of the changes in fairvalue originally and directly included in owners’ equity (the situation where the financial asset transferred is anavailable-for-sale financial asset is involved in).77海南大东海旅游中心股份有限公司2017 年年度报告全文If the partial transfer of financial asset satisfies the criteria for de-recognition, the entire book value of thetransferred financial asset shall be split into the derecognized and recognized part according to their respective fairvalue and the difference between the amounts of the following two items shall be included in the current profitand loss:(1)(2)The book value of the derecognized part;The sum of the consideration for the derecognized part and the portion of de-recognition corresponding tothe accumulated amount of the changes in fair value originally and directly included in owners’ equity (thesituation where the financial asset transferred is an available-for-sale financial asset is involved in).If the transfer of financial assets does not meet the de-recognition criteria, the financial assets shall continue to berecognized, and the consideration received will be recognized as a financial liability.10.4 De-recognition criteria of financial liabilitiesWhere the present obligations of financial liabilities have been discharged in whole or in part, the financialliability is derecognized or any part thereof will be derecognized; if the Company signs an agreement withcreditors to replace the existing financial liabilities by undertaking new financial liabilities, and the new financialliabilities are substantially different from the existing ones in terms of contract terms, the existing financialliabilities will be derecognized, and at the same time, the new financial liability will be recognized.Where substantive changes are made to the contract terms of existing financial liability in whole or in part, theexisting financial liabilities or part thereof will be derecognized, and the financial liability the terms of which havebeen modified will be recognized as a new financial liability.Where financial liabilities are derecognized is whole or in part, the difference between the book value of thefinancial liabilities derecognized and the consideration paid (including non-cash assets transferred out or newfinancial liabilities borne) will be included into current profit and loss.Where the Company repurchases part of a financial liability, the entire book value of the financial liability shall besplit into the derecognized part and continuously-recognized part according to their respective relatively fairvalues on the repurchase date. The difference between the book value of the derecognized part and theconsideration paid (including non-cash assets transferred out or new financial liabilities assumed) shall beincluded in the current profit and loss.10.5 Method of determining the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilitiesThe fair value of a financial instrument, for which there is an active market, is the prices quoted for it therein. Fairvalue of a financial instrument having no active market shall be determined by using valuation techniques. At thetime of valuation, the Company adopts the techniques that are applicable in the current situation and supported byenough available data and other information, selects the input values that are consistent with the features of assetsor liabilities as considered by market participants in relevant asset or liability transactions, and gives priority touse relevant observable inputs. The unobservable inputs are used only under the circumstance when it isimpossible or unobservable inputs to obtain relevant observable inputs.10.6 Testing and accounting methods of impairment of financial assets (excluding receivables)Except for the financial assets measured at fair values through current profit and loss, the book value of financialassets on the balance sheet date should be checked. If there is objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired,78海南大东海旅游中心股份有限公司provision for impairment shall be made.(1)Impairment provision for available-for-sale financial assets:2017 年年度报告全文If the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets has significantly declined at the end of the period, or it isexpected that the trend of decrease in value is non-temporary after considering various relevant factors, theimpairment shall be recognized, and accumulated losses from decreases in fair value originally and directlyincluded in owners’ equity shall be all transferred out and recognized as impairment loss.For available-for-sale debt instruments whose impairment losses have been recognized, if their fair values rise inthe subsequent accounting period and such rise is objectively related to the matters occurring after the recognitionof impairment loss, the previously recognized impairment loss shall be reversed and recorded into the currentprofit and loss.Impairment losses on available-for-sale equity instruments shall not be reversed through profit or loss.(2) Impairment provision for held-to-maturity investments:Measurement of impairment losses on held-to-maturity investments is treated in accordance with the measurementmethod for impairment losses on receivables.11. Accounts receivable(1) Account receivable with individually significant amount and with bad debt provision accrualindependentlyBasis and standard for "individuallyTop 5 accounts receivable and other receivables by individual amount at the end of thesignificant"yearThe Company will separately conduct an impairment test on an individual basis and theallowance for bad debts will be made at the lower of the present value of the expectedMethods for provision for bad debts offuture cash flow and the book value thereof and included in current profit and loss. Thosereceivables with individually significantdo not impair after the separate test shall be included into corresponding portfolio foramount:provision for bad debts. If separate test indicates that there is impairment of receivables,they shall not be included the receivables portfolio with similar risk credit characteristicsfor an impairment test.(2) Receivables with bad debt provision accrual by credit portfolio:PortfolioMethods for provision for bad debtsReceivables provided for bad debts on a portfolio basisAging analysisProvisions for bad debts made by aging analysis method are as follows:√ Applicable □ Not applicableAgingProvision ratio for receivablesProportion ratio for other receivablesWithin 1 year (inclusive)0.00%0.00%79海南大东海旅游中心股份有限公司2017 年年度报告全文1-2 years2-3 years3-4 years4-5 yearsOver 5 years5.00%15.00%25.00%50.00%100.00%5.00%15.00%25.00%50.00%100.00%In combination, withdrawal proportion of bad debt provision based on balance proportion□ Applicable √ Not applicableIn combination, withdrawal proportion of bad debt provision based on other methods:□ Applicable √ Not applicable(3) Accounts receivable with individually insignificant amounts and individual allowance for bad debtReasons for separateAt the end of the year, there are objective evidences showing that the individual balances belowprovision of allowance fortop five are impaired; for example, the debtor is dissolved, bankrupts or dies, and therefore thebad debtsreceivables cannot be recovered after the bankruptcy property or the estate is repaid.if there is an objective evidence thatthe impairment on receivables has occurred, suchreceivables shall be separated from relevant portfolio to conduct impairment test separately,based on which the impairment losses are recognized.Receivables other than accounts receivable and other receivables are subject to impairmentprovision by using the specific identification methods.Provision method ofallowance for bad debts12. InventoriesDoes the Company need to comply with the disclosure requirement of the special industryNo1. ClassificationInventories are classified into: raw materials, stock commodities, low-cost consumables, good materials, fuel, etc.2. Valuation method of inventories dispatchedStock commodity is accounted for at the selling price and the difference between the purchase and sale prices areadjusted on a monthly basis by using the integrated price difference rate. The purchase and storage of all materialsof inventories is measured at actual cost, and by using the first-in first-out method when applied for use. Low-costconsumables are amortized at lump-sum method when applied for use.3. Determining basis of the net realizable value of inventories and method for inventory impairmentprovisionAfter the comprehensive inventory count at the end of the period, provisions for inventory depreciation reserve aremade or adjusted at the lower of their costs or net realizable values.For merchandise inventories for direct sale, including stock commodities, goods in progress and materials for sale,during normal operations, their net realizable values are recognized at the estimated selling prices minus theestimated selling expenses and the relevant taxes and surcharges; for material inventories held for production,80海南大东海旅游中心股份有限公司2017 年年度报告全文their net realizable values are recognized at the estimated selling prices of finished goods minus estimated costsuntil completion, estimated selling expenses and relevant taxes and surcharges.The provisions for inventory depreciation reserve are made on an individual basis at the end of the period; forinventories with large quantities and relatively low unit prices, the provisions for inventory depreciation reserveare made on a category basis. For inventories related to the product portfolios manufactured and sold in the samearea, and of which the final usage or purpose is identical or similar thereto, and which is difficult to separate fromother items for measurement purposes, the provisions for inventory depreciation reserve are made on a portfoliobasis.Where the previous factors affecting the written-down of the value of inventory have disappeared, the amount ofwrite-down shall be resumed and be reversed from the original provision for inventory devaluation with thereversal being included in current profit and loss.4. Inventory systemThe perpetual inventory system is adopted for accounting.5.Amortization methods for low-cost consumables and packaging materials(1)(2)Low-cost consumables are amortized at lump-sum method;Packaging materials: lump-sum write-off method.13. Assets held for sale14. Long-term equity investments1. Judgment criteria for common control and significant influenceJoint control refers to the control shared over an arrangement in accordance with the relevant stipulations, and thedecision-making of related activities of the arrangement should not be made before the party sharing the controlright agrees the same. Where the Company exercises joint control over the investee together with other parties tothe joint venture and enjoys the right on the investee's net assets, the investee is a joint venture of the Company.81海南大东海旅游中心股份有限公司2017 年年度报告全文Significant influence refers to the power to participate in making decisions on the financial and operating policiesof an enterprise, such as appointing representative to the board of directors or similar organs of authority of theinvestee, but not the power to control the investee, or jointly control, the formulation of such policies with otherparties. Where an investor is able to have significant influences on an investee, the investee shall be theCompany's associate.2. Determining of initial investment cost(1)Long-term equity investment acquired from business combinationBusiness combination under the common control: if the Company pays a consideration to the combinee in cash,by transferring non-cash assets or by assuming debts, the share of book value of its owners' equity in the combineein the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate controlling party shall be regarded, on the merger date, asthe initial investment cost of the long-term equity investment. If there is a difference between the initialinvestment cost of the long-term equity investment and the total of book values of the paid cash, transferrednon-cash assets and of assumed debts as well as the face value of issued share, the difference shall be used toadjust the share premium in the capital reserve; and if the share premium in the capital reserve is insufficient to beoffset, retained earnings shall be adjusted.In case the Company can exercise control over the investee under common control for additional investment orother reasons, the initial investment cost of long-term equity investments is recognized at the share of book valueof net asset of the acquiree after the combination in the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate controlleron the combination date. The stock premium should be adjusted at the difference between the initial investmentcost of long-term equity investments on the combination date and the book value of long-term equity investmentsbefore the combination plus the book value of consideration paid for additional shares; if there is no sufficientstock premium for write-downs, the retained earnings are adjusted.Business combination not under the common control: the Company recognizes the combination cost determinedon the combination date as the initial cost of long-term equity investments. Where the Company can control theinvestee not under common control from additional investments, the initial investment cost should be changed tobe accounted for under the cost method and recognized at the sum of the book value of equity investmentsoriginally held and newly increased investment cost. Under business combination not under the common control,the auditing, legal services, consulting and other intermediary fees and other related administrative expenses forbusiness combination will be included into current profit and loss upon occurrence; the transaction costs for theissuance of equity securities or debt securities shall be included into the initial recognition amount of equitysecurities or debt securities.(2)Long-term equity investments obtained by other meansFor long-term equity investments acquired from making payments in cash, the initial cost is the actually paidpurchase cost.For long-term equity investments acquired from issuance of equity securities, the initial investment cost is the fairvalue of the issued equity securities.82海南大东海旅游中心股份有限公司2017 年年度报告全文If the exchange of non-monetary assets has commercial substance and the fair values of assets traded out andtraded in can be measured reliably, the initial cost of long-term equity investment traded in with non-monetaryassets are determined based on the fair values of the assets traded out and the relevant taxes and surchargespayable unless there is any conclusive evidence that the fair values of the assets traded in are more reliable; if theexchange of non-monetary assets does not meet the above criteria, the book value of the assets traded out and therelevant taxes and surcharges payable are recognized as the initial cost of long-term equity investment traded in.For long-term equity investment acquired from debt restructuring, the initial cost is determined based on the fairvalue.3. Subsequent measurements and recognition of gain or loss(1) Long-term equity investment under cost methodLong-term equity investments in subsidiaries are accounted for under the cost method. Except for the actual pricepaid for acquisition of investment or the cash dividends or profits contained in the consideration which have beendeclared but not yet distributed, the Company recognizes the investment income in the current year at the cashdividends or profits declared by the investee.(2) Long-term equity investment accounted for in the equity methodThe Company's long-term equity investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for by using theequity method. If the initial cost is more than the share of the fair value of the investee' identifiable net asset towhich the Company shall be entitled when investing, the initial cost of the long-term equity investment will not beadjusted. If the initial cost of a long-term equity investment is less than the share of the fair value of the investee'sidentifiable net asset to which the Company shall be entitled when investing, the difference shall be included inthe current profit or loss.The Company respectively recognizes the investment income and other comprehensive income according to theshares of net profit or loss and other comprehensive income realized by the investee that should enjoyed orassumed by the Company, and adjusts the book value of long-term equity investment; according to the profitdeclared to be distributed by the investee or the part shall be enjoyed cash dividends calculation, to reduce thebook value of long-term equity investment correspondingly; for other changesin owners' equity excepting for exall profit or loss of the investee, other comprehensive income and profit distribution, the book value of long-termequity investment shall be adjusted and included in the owners' equity.When recognizing the share of net profit or loss of the investee that the Company shall enjoy, based on fair valueof various identifiable assets and others of the investee on acquisition and according to accounting policies andaccounting periods of the Company, the Company shall recognize such share after making adjustments to netprofit of the investee. When holding the investment, the investee should prepare the consolidated financialstatements, it shall account for the investment income based on the net profit, other comprehensive income andthe changes in other owner's equity attributable to the investee.83海南大东海旅游中心股份有限公司2017 年年度报告全文The Company shall write off the part of incomes from internal unrealized transactions between the Company andassociates and joint ventures which are attributable to the Company according to the corresponding ratio andrecognize the profit and loss on investments on such basis. Where the losses from internal transactions betweenthe Company and the investee fall into the scope of assets impairment loss, the full amount of such losses shouldbe recognized. For transactions on investments or sales of assets between the Company and associates and jointventures, where such assets constitute business, they should be accounted for according to the relevant policies.When the Company recognizes its share of loss incurred to the investee, treatment shall be done in the followingsequence: firstly, the book value of the long-term equity investment shall be reduced; secondly, where the bookvalue thereof is insufficient to cover the share of losses, investment losses are recognized to the extent of bookvalue of other long-term equities which form net investment in the investee in substance and the book value oflong term receivables shall be reduced. Finally, after all the above treatments, if the Company is still responsiblefor any additional liability in accordance with the provisions stipulated in the investment contracts or agreements,provisions are recognized and included into current investment loss according to the obligations estimated toundertake. An investing party shall recognize the net loss incurred by the invested entity until the book value ofthe long-term equity investment and other long-term interests which substantially form the net investment in theinvested entity are reduced to zero, unless the investing party is obliged to undertake extra losses. If the investedentity realizes any net profit later, the investing party shall, after the amount of its attributable share of profitsoffsets its attributable share of the unrecognized losses, resume recognizing its attributable share of profits.(3) Disposal of long-term equity investmentsFor disposal of long-term equity investments, the difference between the book value and the actual price shall beincluded into the current profit or loss.Where a long-term equity investment is accounted for under the equity method, accounting treatment should bemade on the part which is originally included in other comprehensive income according to corresponding ratio byusing the same basis for the investee to directly dispose of the relevant assets or liabilities when the investmentsare disposed of. Owner's equity recognized from the investee's changes in other owner's equity other than netprofit or loss, other comprehensive income and profit distribution should all transferred to the current profit andloss in proportion.In case the joint control or significant influence over the investee is lost for disposing part of equity investments orother reasons, the remaining equity will be changed to be accounted for according to the recognition andmeasurement principles of financial instruments. The difference between the fair value and the book value on thedate of the loss of joint control or significant influence should be included in the current profit and loss. As toother comprehensive income recognized based on measurement of the original equity investment under the equitymethod, accounting treatment shall be made on the same basis as would be required if the investee had directly84海南大东海旅游中心股份有限公司2017 年年度报告全文disposed of the assets or liabilities related thereto when measurement under the equity method is terminated.Owner's equity recognized from the investee's changes in other owner's equity other than net profit or loss, othercomprehensive income and profit distribution should all transferred to the current profit and loss when the equitymethod confirmed is no longer adopted.Where the Company loses the control over the investee due to disposal of partial equity investments or otherreasons, when it prepares separate financial statements, the remaining equity after disposal that can jointly controlor have significant influence on the investee will be measured at the equity method, and the remaining equityshould be deemed to have been adjusted at equity method on acquisition;If the remaining equity after disposal cannot exercise joint control or significant influence on the investee, suchinvestments should be accounted for according to the provisions on the recognition and measurement of financialinstruments and the difference between fair value and book value on the date of loss of the control should beincluded in the current profit and loss.Where the disposed equities are acquired by the enterprise combination due to the reasons such as additionalinvestment, the remaining equities after the disposal are calculated based on the cost method or equity method inpreparing the individual financial statements, and other comprehensive income and other owners' equityrecognized because of the equity method adopted for the calculation of the equity investment held prior to thepurchase date are carried forward in proportion; the remaining equities after the disposal are changed to be madein accordance with the relevant provisions in the recognition and measurement criteria of financial instrumentswhile other comprehensive income and other owners' equity are carried forward in full.15. Investment propertyMeasurement modeMeasured by cost methodDepreciation or amortization methodInvestment properties are properties to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both. Examples include landleased out under operating leases, land held for long-term capital appreciation, buildings leased out underoperating leases, (including buildings that have been constructed or developed for future lease out under operatingleases, and buildings that are being constructed or developed for future lease out under operating leases).The Company measures the existing investment properties by using the cost model. For investment propertymeasured by using the cost model, the buildings for lease shall be depreciated by using policies the same as usedfor fixed assets of the Company, and the land use rights for lease shall be amortized by using the same policies asapplicable to intangible assets.85海南大东海旅游中心股份有限公司16. Fixed assets(1) Recognition criteria of fixed assets2017 年年度报告全文Fixed assets refer to the tangible assets held for the purpose of producing commodities, rendering services, rentingor business management with usefullives exceeding one year. Fixed assets are recognized when theysimultaneously meet the following conditions:(1)(2)It is probable that the economic benefits relating to the fixed assets will flow into the Company; andThe costs of the fixed asset can be measured reliably.(2) Depreciation method of fixed assetsAsset typeDepreciation methodYear for depreciationResidual value rateHouses and buildingsStraight-line method20-40Mechanical equipmentStraight-line method8-20EntertainmentequipmentTransportationequipmentStraight-line method5-16Straight-line method7-12Other equipmentStraight-line method855555Yearly depreciationrate4.75-2.3711.87-4.7519-5.9313.57-7.9111.87(3) Reorganization basis, valuation and depreciation method for financial lease assets17. Construction in progressDoes the Company need to comply with the disclosure requirement of the special industryNoThe book-entry values of the fixed assets are stated at total expenditures incurred before reaching workingcondition for their intended use. For construction in progress that has reached working conditions for its intendeduse but for which the completion of settlement has not been handled, it shall be transferred into fixed assets at theestimated value according to the project budget, construction price or actual cost, etc. from the date when itreaches the working conditions for its intended use. The fixed assets shall be depreciated in accordance with theCompany’s policy on fixed asset depreciation. Adjustment shall be made to the originally and provisionallyestimated value based on the actual cost after the completion of settlement is handled, but depreciation alreadyprovided will not be adjusted.18. Borrowing costs1. Recognition principles of capitalization of borrowing costs86海南大东海旅游中心股份有限公司2017 年年度报告全文Borrowing costs include the interest of borrowings, the amortization of discount or premium, auxiliary expenses,exchange differences incurred by foreign currency borrowings, etc.The borrowing costs incurred to the Company and directly attributable to the acquisition and construction orproduction of assets eligible for capitalization should be capitalized and recorded into relevant asset costs; otherborrowing costs should be recognized as costs according to the amount incurred and be included into the currentprofit and loss.Assets eligible for capitalization refer to fixed assets, investment property, inventories and other assets which mayreach their intended use or sale status only after long-time acquisition and construction or production activities.Borrowing costs may be capitalized only when all the following conditions are met at the same time:(1)Asset disbursements, which include those incurred by cash payment, the transfer of non-cash assets or theundertaking of interest-bearing debts for acquiring and constructing or producing assets eligible for capitalization,have already been incurred;(2)(3)Borrowing costs have already been incurred;Purchase, construction or manufacturing activities that are necessary to prepare the assets for theirintended use are in progress.2. Capitalization period of borrowing costsCapitalization period refers to the period from commencement of capitalization of borrowing costs to its cessation;period of suspension for capitalization is excluded.Capitalization of borrowing costs should cease when the acquired and constructed or produced assets eligible forcapitalization have reached the working condition for their intended use or sale.When some projects among the acquired and constructed or produced assets eligible for capitalization arecompleted and can be used separately, the capitalization of borrowing costs of such projects should be ceased.If all parts of the acquired and constructed or produced assets are completed but the assets cannot be used or soldexternally until overall completion, the capitalization of borrowing costs should be ceased at the time of overallcompletion of the said assets.3. Period of suspension for capitalizationIf the acquisition and construction or production activities of assets eligible for capitalization are abnormallyinterrupted and such condition lasts for more than three months, the capitalization of borrowing costs should besuspended; if the interruption is necessary procedures for the acquired, constructed or produced assets eligible forcapitalization to reach the working conditions for its intended use or sale, the borrowing costs continue to becapitalized. Borrowing costs incurred during the interruption are recognized as the current profit and loss andcontinue to be capitalized until the acquisition, construction or production of the asset restarts.4. Calculation of capitalization amount of borrowing costsAs for special borrowings borrowed for acquiring and constructing or producing assets eligible for capitalization,borrowing costs of special borrowing actually incurred in the current period less the interest income of theborrowings unused and deposited in bank or return on temporary investment should be recognized as thecapitalization amount of borrowing costs.As for general borrowings used for acquiring and constructing or producing assets eligible for capitalization, the87海南大东海旅游中心股份有限公司2017 年年度报告全文interest of general borrowings to be capitalized should be calculated by multiplying the weighted average of assetdisbursements of the part of accumulated asset disbursements exceeding special borrowings at end of each monthby the capitalization rate of used general borrowings. The capitalization rate is calculated by weighted averageinterest rate of general borrowings.As for borrowings with discount or premium, the to-be-amortized discount or premium in each accounting periodshould be recognized by effective interest rate method, and the interest for each period should be adjusted.19. Biological assets20. Oil-and-gas assets21. Intangible assets(1) Valuation method, useful lives and impairment1．．Valuation method of intangible assets．．(1)The Company initially measures intangible assets at cost on acquisition;The costs of externally purchased intangible assets include purchase prices, relevant taxes and surcharges andother directly attributable expenditures incurred to prepare the assets for their intended use. If the payment for anintangible asset is delayed beyond the normal credit conditions and it is of the financing nature, the cost of theintangible asset shall be determined on the basis of the current value of the purchase price.For an intangible asset obtained in debt restructuring by a debtor for the settlement of relevant liability, thebook-entry value shall be initially recognized based on the fair value of the intangible asset. Difference betweenthe book value of restructured debts and the fair value of the intangible asset used for debt off-set shall beincluded in the current profit or loss;On the premise that non-monetary assets trade is of commercial nature and the fair value of the assets traded in orout can be measured reliably, the intangible assets traded in with non-monetary assets should be recognized at thefair value of the assets traded out, unless any unambiguous evidence indicates that the fair value of the assetstraded in is more reliable; as to the non-monetary assets trade not meeting the aforesaid premise, the book value ofthe assets traded out and related taxes and surcharges payable should be recognized as the cost of the intangibleassets, with gains or losses not recognized.For intangible assets acquired from business combination under common control, the initial book value areinitially recognized at the book value of the combinee; for intangible assets acquired from business combinationnot under common control, the initial book value are initially recognized at the fair value.Costs of intangible assets developed internally and independently include: the costs of materials and labor servicesused to develop the intangible assets, the registration fee, the amortization of other patents and franchise used inthe process of development, the interest expenses meeting the condition for capitalization, and other directexpenses for preparing the intangible assets for their intended use.88海南大东海旅游中心股份有限公司(2)Subsequent measurement2017 年年度报告全文The useful lives of the intangible assets are analyzed and determined on their acquisition.For intangible assets with definite useful lives, the Company shall adopt the straight-line method for amortizationwithin the period during which they can bring economic benefits to the Company; where the period during whichthey can bring economic benefits to the Company cannot be forecast, those intangible assets shall be deemed asassets with indefinite lives and no amortization will be made.2. Estimates of useful lives of intangible assets with definite useful livesItemEstimated useful livesBasisLand use rights50 yearsUse term for the land use right titleThe useful life and amortization method of intangible assets with limited useful life are reviewed at the end ofeach period.Upon review, the useful lives and amortization method of the intangible assets as at the end of the year were notdifferent from those estimated before.3. Judgment basis for intangible assets with indefinite useful livesAs at the balance sheet date, the Company has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.Note: explain the measurement of intangible assets. Explain the estimation condition for use of life, while the intangible assets havelimited service life. If the intangible assets have uncertain use of life, explain the judgment basis and procedures for use of life(2) Accounting policy of internal R&D expenditures22. Impairment of long-term assetsFor the long-term equity investments, investment properties, fixed assets, construction in progress, intangibleassets, and other long-term assets measured at cost model, if there are signs of impairment, an impairment test willbe conducted on the balance sheet date. If impairment test results indicate that the recoverable amounts of theassets are lower than their book value, the provision for impairment is made based on the differences, which arerecognized as impairment losses. The recoverable amounts of intangible assets are the higher of their fair valuesless costs to sell and the present values of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the assets. The assetsimpairment provision is calculated and made on an individual basis. If it is difficult for the Company to estimatethe recoverable amount of the individual asset, the recoverable amount of an asset group to which the said assetbelongs to will be determined. Asset group is the minimum combination of assets that can independently generatecash inflows.After the losses from asset impairment are recognized, they are not reversed in subsequent periods.23. Long-term deferred expensesLong-term deferred expenses refer to various expenses which have been already incurred but will be born in thereporting period and in the future with an amortization period of over one year.1. Amortization methodLong-term deferred expenses are evenly amortized over the beneficial period2. Amortization period89海南大东海旅游中心股份有限公司2017 年年度报告全文ItemAmortization periodHotel exterior decorationFire stairs renovationC FLOOR ROOM RENOVATIONVilla renovationSwimming pool renovation24. Employee compensation4年4年5年5年5年(1) Accounting method for short-term compensationDuring the accounting period when employees serve the Company, the actual short-term compensation isrecognized as liabilities and included in current profit and loss or costs associated with assets.The appropriate amount of employee compensation payable will be determined during the accounting periodwhen the employees provide services for the Company based on the medical insurance, work injury insurance andmaternity insurance and other social insurance and housing fund paid by the Company for employees, as well astrade union funds and employee education funds withdrawn according to provisions at the accrual basis andaccrual ratio.The employee benefits in the non-monetary form shall be measured at fair value.(2) Accounting method for post-employment benefitsWhere the Company cannot unilaterally withdraw the dismissal welfare offered in view of the cancellation of thelabor relation plan or the layoff proposal, or recognizes the cost or expenses as to the restructuring involving thepayment of dismissal welfare (whichever is earlier), the employee compensation arising from the dismissalwelfare should be recognized as the liabilities and charged to the current profit or loss.(3) Accounting method for dismiss welfareThe Company will pay basic old-age insurance and unemployment insurance in accordance with relevantprovisions of the local government for employees. During the accounting period when they provide services forthe Company, the amount payable will be calculated at the basis and proportion specified by local authorities,recognized as a liability and charged into current profit and loss or costs associated with assets.(4) Accounting method for other long-term employee welfare25. Estimated liabilitiesWhen the Company is involved in litigation, debt guarantees, loss-making contract, reorganization matters, if such90海南大东海旅游中心股份有限公司2017 年年度报告全文matters are likely to be satisfied by delivery of assets or provision of services in the future and the amount can bemeasured reliably, they shall be recognized as estimated liabilities.1. Recognition criteria for estimated liabilitiesWhen an obligation relating to a contingency meets all the following conditions at the same time, it is recognizedas an estimated liability:(1)Such obligation is a present obligation of the Company;(2) The performance of such obligation may well cause outflows of economic benefits from the Company; and(3)The amount of such obligation can be measured reliably.2. Measurement method of estimated liabilitiesThe estimated liabilities of the Company are initially measured as the best estimate of expenses required for theperformance of relevant present obligations.When the Company determines the best estimate, it should have a comprehensive consideration of risks withrespect to contingencies, uncertainties and the time value of money. If the time value of money is significant, thebest estimates will be determined after discount of relevant future cash outflows.The best estimates shall be treated as follows in different circumstances:If there is continuous range (or interval) for the necessary expenses, and probabilities of occurrence of all theoutcomes within this range are equal, the best estimates will be determined at the average amount of upper andlower limits within the range.If there is no continuous range (or interval) for the necessary expenses, or probabilities of occurrence of all theoutcomes within this range are unequal despite such a range exists, in case that the contingency involves a singleitem, the best estimate shall be determined at the most likely outcome; if the contingency involves two or moreitems,the best estimate should be determined according to allthe possible outcomes with their relevantprobabilities.When all or part of the expenses necessary for the settlement of estimated liabilities of the Company are expectedto be compensated by a third party, the compensation shall be separately recognized as an asset only when it isvirtually certain to be received. The compensation recognized shall not exceed the book value of the estimatedliabilities.26. share-based paymentNil27.

The inconformity time is July, 2006, and thehotel’s CT is changing on April, 2016. Therefore, undercounted electricity consumption amount is 10,313,373.00 kilowatt-hours, andestimated cost is 7,200,165.75 Yuan as various electricity prices and charges.According to the file “Law Advisory Opinion about Retroactive Power (Charge) Dispute between South China Grand Hotel andSanya Power Supply Bureau” issued by Beijing Junhe (Haikou) Law Firm at December 20, 2016, which claims that Sanya PowerSupply Bureau has responsibility for CT to purchase, install, enseal, unseal and change, therefore, the responsibility of the guiltyparty for undercounted electricity consumption of South China Grand Hotel is Sanya Power Supply Bureau. According to the onehundred and thirty-five item of “General Rule of Civil Law”, this item claims that limitation of action is two years if accuser requestpeople's court’s protection, except situations provided by law.
